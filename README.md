A basic game of clicking the monster, each monster has a few set of lives </br>

you can buy an auto clicker as well and upgrade it.</br>
It was made as part of an institute project to showcase implementation
of diffrent android built in libraries. </br>

- the goal was to build an app without using any external sources 
  and an extensive use of built-in android libraries as part of the project requirements
- it mainly shows:
  - the use of ObjectAnimator
  - the use of SharedPreferences
  - the implementation of threads
  - the use of ListView including its adapter
  - the use of SQLiteOpenHelper as the DB for the scores
